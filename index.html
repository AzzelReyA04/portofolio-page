          I am a dedicated, detail-oriented back-end developer with a strong interest in building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. I focus on developing database management, well-structured server-side logic, and API Integration
          to support seamless user experiences. I have experience working in organizational and professional environments, including as a staff member of the Learning Management Division at Bina Nusantara English Club (BNEC) and as a member
          of Bina Nusantara Nippon Club. I further strengthened my technical skills through hands-on experience as a back-end intern at Flash Coffee, where I contributed to server-side development and system workflows, and supported digital
          product development at ALGO.CORE. With a background that combines technical implementation and an understanding of user-centered design, I am eager to grow as a back-end developer who can adapt to evolving technologies and deliver
          robust solutions for real-world applications.

            <p>
              During my time as a college student, my teammate and I were tasked to create a website for a fictional restaurant named Danbam. This app provides several features such as an "About Us" page to learn the background of the
              restaurant, a "Menu" page where users can see some of the restaurant's best meals and drinks, a "Location" page to let the users know the locations of DanBam, and a "Contact Us" page if the user has any questions about the
              restaurant.

              I've made a challenge for myself to lead a team of 3 in order to design an educational website. This leads me to create CS Course that provides free online courses for people to learn everything they need to know about
              Computer Science. Each different course provides an E-Book, video learning, and exercises. This website also includes a forum page where users can interact with each other and share their knowledge regarding a certain topic.

            <p>
              In a reasearch I have done with my teammates, we have found certain difficulties in gardening or farming. These problems resolves around uncertainty in maintaining and caring for plants, the unavailability of proper direction
              on how to farm from experts, and the ignorance in the exact harvest time. In order to slove these issues, we have come up with a solution in a form of a gardening app named GarMob or Gardening Mobile. GarMob will help someone
              in planting, by providing recommendations for tools and materials as well as planting media for each plant so that the tools and materials selected are appropriate and the user can get success in gardening and be able to
              harvest.

            <p>
              During the last semester of my college years, my teammate and I created a learning website for basic programming called Belajaritma for our research by using PHP and the Laravel Framework. The Belajaritma application is a
              learning website that can help users learn about the basics of programming. With this application, users can study basic programming materials in video and PDF form, do assignments and final tests as evaluation material, do
              paid certifications for special fields, and discuss together with the forum feature.

          <p>
            During my time as a college student, I joined an internship for PT Sembilan Puluh Enam Derajat or Flash Coffee for my enrichment program. "Flash Coffee" is one of the fast-growing coffee technology-based outlets in Asia (for
            example in Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and South Korea). With this oppurunity, I was able to develop my skills as a back-end developper by developing APIs to support mobile application functionality,
            becoming familiar with Javascript (Node.js), developing and maintaining reusable code libraries, implementing security best practices in the code, reviewing server code for optimization, designing and implementing data storage
            solutions, testing and writing technical documentation, and communicate with users to understand their needs and experiences
